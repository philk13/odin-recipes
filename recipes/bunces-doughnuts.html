    <h1>Bunce's Doughnuts</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bunce was a duck-and-goose farmer. He kept thousands of ducks and geese. He was a kind of pot-bellied dwarf. He was so short his chin would have been underwater in the shallow end of any swimming-pool in the world. His food was doughnuts and goose-livers. He mashed the livers into a disgusting paste and then stuffed the paste into the doughnuts. This diet gave him a tummy-ache and a beastly temper.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup light brown sugar, firmly packed</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 pound all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon cinnamon</li>
        <li>a large pinch of salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons hot water</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>vegetable oil for deep frying</li>
        <li>sugar for coating</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cream the brown sugar and butter until pale and creamy — this can be done using a food processor.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the egg until blended.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining ingredients. The dough should be fairly stiff but smooth.</li>
        <li>Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours</li>
        <li>Divide the dough in half and return one half to the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>On a floured surface roll out the other half of the dough to a quarter-inch thick. With the cutters cut out as many doughnuts as possible, using the large one to cut the doughnut shape and the smaller one to make the hole.</li>
        <li>Gather up the scraps and roll and cut out as many additional doughnuts as possible. Repeat the rolling and cutting with the remaining half of the dough.</li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil to 375ºF.</li>
        <li>Fry the doughnuts in small batches, turning once, until deep golden brown.</li>
        <li>Drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Put the sugar in a bowl and add a few doughnuts at a time, shaking them in the sugar until coated. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
